I work with engineering and data platforms at the moment when a project stops being an experiment and becomes a product.

My responsibility begins where the cost of mistakes and changes becomes higher than the cost of development. I focus not on introducing technologies, but on operational stability, architectural boundaries, and controlled change in systems built on open source solutions.

I am most useful at transition stages. When the platform is already running, teams have grown, and simple solutions no longer work.

## Typical situations

- The platform has grown faster than the team and processes
- Operations have become more expensive than development
- Every change carries a high risk
- Architecture formally exists, but decisions are made situationally
- The support team lacks a holistic view of the system
- The project has officially become a product, but no one was ready for it

In these moments the problem is rarely a specific technology. More often it is the loss of control and shared context.

## Approach

I treat architecture as a set of conscious trade-offs, not as an ideal diagram. Operations and change are primary concerns, not side effects of development.

My goal is to make the system reproducible, understandable, and maintainable without constant manual intervention or loss of context.

## Engagement formats

- Architectural oversight of critical changes
- Advisory support for operations and evolution
- Participation in complex incidents
- Support during the transition from project to product

If these situations sound familiar, you can reach out directly. A conversation always starts with understanding the context and the problem.
