I am an engineer and platform specialist. Most of my work happens when a system is already running and stops being an experiment, and the project begins to live as a product.

Formally, I am often hired as a DevOps engineer. In practice, my responsibility lies at the intersection of operations, architecture, and change management. I work to ensure that systems built on open source solutions remain controllable, predictable, and supportable as load, teams, and requirements grow.

In most projects there are already architects, managers, and engineering teams. I do not replace them and I do not compete with them. My role is to close the gap between architectural decisions and real operations, where constraints, trade-offs, and consequences appear that cannot be seen on diagrams.

## Focus areas

- Operational stability of systems
- Architectural boundaries and ownership
- Controlled change after launch
- Preservation and transfer of context, not just documentation

I pay close attention to how decisions are made after launch. Where responsibility boundaries lie between teams. Which changes are safe and which create long-term risk. How to preserve system logic when a project enters a product phase and new roles and processes appear.

I do not specialize in introducing individual technologies and I do not sell toolsets. What matters to me is the system lifecycle, the cost of mistakes, and the irreversibility of decisions. I treat operations and change as first-class requirements, not as side effects of development.

My value is situational. I am most effective during transition phases, complex incidents, and situations where careful judgment and understanding of consequences matter more than speed.
